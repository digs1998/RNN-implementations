# Simple RNN model addition

**Libraries**
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Numpy

**Aim was to make the model perform on a given string "54+7", the model should return a prediction: "61".

**Workflow**
1. Load the libraries
2. Generating data by specifying a set of characters to be used.
3. Vectorize and Devetorize data
4. create data by defining a function
5. Training the model and predictions

**The model was able to perform the task with accuracy of more than 90%**
